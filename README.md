## 📡 Transmission
**tashitech.ai** is a high-density, minimalist Single Page Application (SPA) designed to showcase next-generation infrastructure services at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, and Blockchain technology.

Built with a philosophy of **Radical Minimalism** and **High-Density Intelligence**, the platform mimics the fluid physics of Apple's UI combined with the data-dense aesthetic of Palantir.

## ⚡ Service Capabilities

Tashi Technologies delivers a complete ecosystem of digital infrastructure:

- **AI Solutions:** Custom LLM integration, Agent Identity, and Autonomous Systems.
- **Web Development:** High-performance Full-Stack (MERN) web applications.
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Scalable serverless and containerized deployments.
- **Hyper-Automation:** Advanced workflows using **n8n**, **Zapier**, and **Make.com**.
- **Blockchain:** On-chain governance and smart contract auditing.

## 🛠 Architecture & Stack

This project leverages a modern, performance-first stack to deliver 60fps animations and instant state transitions.

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | React 19 | Component-based architecture with strict typing. |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling for rapid, consistent design systems. |
| **Motion** | Framer Motion | Physics-based animations, layout transitions, and scroll reveals. |
| **Icons** | Lucide React | Clean, lightweight SVG iconography. |
| **Typography** | Inter | Variable font mirroring system-ui aesthetics. |

## ✨ Key Technical Features

- **State-Based Virtual Routing:** Seamless view transitions without page reloads, preserving the "App-like" feel.
- **Glassmorphism 2.0:** Dynamic, scroll-aware headers with backdrop blurring and localized border glows.
- **Bento Grid Layouts:** Responsive, content-heavy grid systems for service visualization.
- **Physics-Based Interactions:** Hover states, drag constraints, and spring animations that feel weighted and physical.
- **Dark Mode Native:** Designed exclusively for dark environments with specialized "Tashi Black" (#000000) and "Off-Black" (#080808) surfaces.

## 🎨 Design System

The UI enforces a strict set of design tokens to maintain brand integrity.

- **Primary Canvas:** `#000000` (Void Black)
- **Surface Layer:** `#080808` (Obsidian)
- **Accent:** `#3B82F6` (Electric Blue)
- **Typography:** `Inter` (Tight tracking, high contrast)

## 📦 Deployment

This architecture is optimized for edge deployment via **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

1. Connect your GitHub repository.
2. Set build command to `npm run build`.
3. Set output directory to `build` (or `dist`).
4. Deploy.
